#+TITLE: Workshop: Messing with MicroPython

This is a small project built in a workshop at the [[https://www.fh-wedel.de/][FH Wedel]] lead by [[https://www.fh-wedel.de/wir/organisation/team/detail/profil/profile/show/Timm-Bostelmann/][Timm Bostelmann]].

It combines reading a digital gyroscope sensor via I2C with utilizing the proprietary [[https://www.espressif.com/en/solutions/low-power-solutions/esp-now][ESP-NOW]] protocol for communication between multiple [[https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits/esp32-devkitc][ESP32 DevKitC]] boards.

The setup can be simulated online using [[https://wokwi.com/projects/401831442593590273][Wokwi]].
